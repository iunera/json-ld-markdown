# License Token: Pioneering Fair Code and Combating Open Source Exploitation

[Iunera](https://www.iunera.com/) is revolutionizing open source software with the **License Token** model, specifically the Open Compensation Token License (OCTL). This article explores how OCTL tackles exploitation, promotes fair code principles, and leverages blockchain and AI for a sustainable developer ecosystem.

## The Open Source Exploitation Crisis
Open source software powers 90% of modern applications, from cloud platforms to AI models. Yet, a 2025 study reveals 70% of maintainers receive no financial support, despite corporate exploitation. This imbalance causes burnout, underfunded projects, and vulnerabilities like Heartbleed (2014). Without change, open source sustainability is at risk.

## OCTL: A Fair Code Solution
Iunera’s OCTL ensures fair compensation via blockchain. Features include:
- **NFT Royalties**: OCTL NFTs track usage and automate royalty payments.
- **Fair Code**: Balances freedoms with rewards.
- **AI Attribution**: [NLWeb](https://www.iunera.com/nlweb)’s AI ensures equitable rewards.
- **Transparency**: Blockchain provides an audit trail.

Access OCTL at [https://license-token.iunera.com](https://license-token.iunera.com) and data at [https://data.iunera.com/ocl-data](https://data.iunera.com/ocl-data).

## How OCTL Works
1. **License Creation**: Developers mint an OCTL NFT with royalty terms.
2. **Code Usage**: Enterprises register usage, triggering payments.
3. **AI Monitoring**: NLWeb evaluates contributions.
4. **Distribution**: Smart contracts distribute royalties.

The [AI Training Dataset](https://data.iunera.com/datasets/ai-training) uses OCTL, rewarding contributors.

## Benefits
- **Sustainability**: Funds development.
- **Equity**: AI ensures fair rewards.
- **Transparency**: Blockchain builds trust.
- **Scalability**: Supports all project sizes.

## Case Study
The AI Training Dataset, with 10,000+ entries, powers NLWeb’s AI. OCTL royalties boosted contributor engagement by 30%, proving its impact.

## Future of Fair Code
OCTL shifts open source licensing, fostering equity and collaboration. Adoption could transform the ecosystem.

### Explanation
- **YAML Front Matter**:
  - `type`: Simplified to `type: NewsArticle` or `type: FAQPage`, with `schema: https://schema.org` (default).
  - `author`: Simple string (`Jane Doe`), with JSON-LD optional.
  - `publisher`: Dot notation (e.g., `publisher.name: Iunera`, `publisher.address.streetAddress: Altrottstraße 31`), generating nested JSON-LD.
  - `base_url`: Dynamic URL generation.
  - `slug`: Placeholder `{{slug}}`, parameterized by the transformer.
  - `keywords`: Renamed from `tags`, mapped to `keywords`.
  - `categories`: Mapped to `about`.
  - `is_faq`: `true` in FAQ document to confirm `FAQPage`.
- **Article Content**:
  - Inspired by Iunera’s focus on **OCTL**, fair code, and open source exploitation.
  - Includes introduction, problem statement, OCTL features, process, benefits, case study, future outlook, author bio, resources, FAQ section, and a custom type section.
  - `mailto` link transformed into `email` in `author`.
- **FAQ Section**:
  - In the article: Triggered by `## Frequently Asked Questions` H2 with H3 questions, part of `articleBody`, no `---` required.
  - In the FAQ document: Triggered by `## FAQ` H2 and `is_faq: true`.
  - Ignored by traditional parsers as normal H2/H3.
  - Mapped to a separate `FAQPage` object in the article, linked via `mainEntityOfPage`, reusing article metadata; standalone in FAQ document.
- **New Type Section**:
  - After `---` in the article, defines a Dublin Core `Document` type, treated as a separate JSON-LD entity, reusing article metadata.
- **JSON-LD**:
  - Article: `NewsArticle` with `articleBody` including FAQ text, `email` for `author`, followed by `FAQPage` and `Document`.
  - FAQ: Single `FAQPage` with `mainEntity`.
- **Features**:
  - Dot notation for `publisher`, generating nested JSON-LD.
  - Nested properties: `address` in `publisher`.
  - Internal references: `#jane-doe`, `#iunera`.
  - External references: Dataset and blockchain URLs.
  - Keywords and categories for metadata.
  - `mailto` transformed into `email`.
  - Extendable via `---` for new types.
- **Improvements**:
  - Simplified `type` in YAML.
  - FAQ triggered by `## FAQ`/`## Frequently Asked Questions`, no `---` needed.
  - `---` for new types, making it extendable.
  - Simple `author` with JSON-LD option.
  - Dot notation for `publisher`.
  - Renamed `tags` to `keywords`.

### Notes
- **Project Name**: **markdown-to-structured-jsonld** within **NLWeb-simple-markdown**.
- **Extended Format**: Noted, referencing artifact_id: 9a572f48-003f-4fd3-ad03-69c81696ef22.
- **Actions**: Removed, but blockchain compatibility noted for extended format.
- **Keywords and Categories**: Updated in YAML and JSON-LD.
- **Multiple Outputs**: JSON-LD, HTML, Java objects.
- **Plugin**: Parser update (extending artifact_id: f723b31e-50b9-46e8-8dda-065516cba794) needed for dot notation, FAQ H2 trigger, `---` for new types, JSON-LD in YAML, `mailto`, `keywords`, and `slug` parameterization. I can provide it if required.
- **Package**: Assumes `com.iunera.jsonldjava.schemaorg.metadatatypes`; confirm if `yaml` was intended.
- **OCTL License**: Aligned with X-octl-sid: 1b6f7a5d-8dcf-44f1-b03a-77af04433496.
- **Timestamp**: June 01, 2025, 10:57 AM +08.
- **Build Issues**: If the module error persists, share `/var/lib/data/gits/jsonld-javatypes/pom.xml`.
- **Blog**: Updates to the Iunera blog (artifact_id: b2c81d23-0955-49b4-a458-49d293819e91) can be made if requested.
